[1] "[Unified M-estimation of Matrix Exponential Spatial Dynamic Panel Specification]" (Job Market Paper, under review)

Abstract: In this paper a unified M-estimation method is proposed for the matrix exponential spatial dynamic panel specification (MESDPS) with fixed effect in short panels. The quasi-maximum likelihood (QML) estimation for  dynamic panel data (DPD) model has long been known to have the initial condition specification difficulty, which leads to bias and inconsistency. The MESDPS also suffers from this problem. The initial-condition free M-estimator in this paper solves this problem and is proved to be consistent and asymptotic normal. An outer product of martingale difference (OPMD) estimator for the variance-covariance (VC) matrix of the M-estimator is also derived and proved to be consistent. MESDPS with a matrix exponential spatial specification (MESS) in the dependent variable, the lagged dependent variable and the disturbances are represented by MESDPS(1,1,1). Monte Carlo experiments results for finite sample properties of the M-estimator and the OPMD estimator of MESDPS(1,1,1) and various submodels are reported. The method is applied to US outward FDI data to show its validity.
